# CSAPP-lab
Records of self-study of CSAPP and corresponding course labs

Because I'm a self-learner,all the labs are from [https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html)

Due to my limited time, only complete assignment solutions and some personal ideas are provided here, but there are no detailed solutions or analysis processes. To some extent, this is not only a form of sharing, but perhaps more importantly, a record of my own insights  during the learning process.

It makes no sense to directly use the answers. One must experience the joy in their own exploration and attempts.
